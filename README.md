## Description

This project implements a simple 2D robot arm manipulator control using a Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller. The aim is to provide an effective simulation and visualization of the robot arm's movements and control.

You can use any control theory to determine the control gains. Modify the values in the `parameter.m` file.

## Files

- **main:** Execute this file to run the main simulation.
  
- **parameter:** Contains all parameters of the robotic arm, including control gains. This file runs automatically.
  
- **plotEE:** A script that plots the end-effector position based on simulation time. This file runs automatically.
  
- **ArmPlot:** A script for visualizing the robotic arm in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system.
  
- **Simulasi_DIY:** A Simulink file designed to simulate the robotic arm.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and execute the `main` file or download and move to your own directory.

### Prerequisites

- [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) (for running the Simulink file and scripts).
- Please make sure Simulink has been installed.
